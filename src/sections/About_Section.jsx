                I have completed my Bachelor of Technology in Mechanical Engineering from Biju Patnaik University, Odisha, India. Over time, I have developed a strong interest in UI/UX design and web technologies, allowing me to work with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and .NET UI.
              </p>

              <p className="hero_text">
                I am currently working as a UI Designer, where I work extensively with .NET UI components and gain hands-on experience in building interactive user interfaces. I also contribute to several projects, collaborating with teams to design and develop engaging digital experiences.

                I was born and brought up in Dhenkanal, Odisha, a small yet beautiful town. My parents have always been my biggest support systemâ€”my father runs a Business, and my mother manages domestic work. Being their only child, I deeply appreciate their hard work and sacrifices, which have shaped me into who I am today.

                Beyond coding and designing, I have a passion for cricket, traveling, and watching movies. Exploring new places and learning new technologies always excites me, and I continuously strive to improve my skills and stay updated with the latest trends in Web development.
